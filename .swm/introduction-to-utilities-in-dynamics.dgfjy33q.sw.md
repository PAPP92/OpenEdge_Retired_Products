# Introduction to Utilities in Dynamics

Utilities in Dynamics refer to a set of helper functions and procedures that facilitate various operations within the Dynamics framework. These utilities include functionalities for managing windows, styles, and other UI components, making it easier to build and maintain user interfaces. They also provide additional support for handling specific tasks such as extra processing requirements, enhancing the overall capabilities of the Dynamics framework.

# Managing Windows

One of the key utilities in Dynamics is the ability to manage windows within the application. This is achieved using the <SwmToken path="dynamics/src/main/abl/af/sup/winstyle.p" pos="142:3:3" line-data="     use SetWindowPos. Great, we need SetWindowPos anyway">`SetWindowPos`</SwmToken> function, which sets the position of windows. This function is essential for ensuring that windows are displayed correctly and in the desired location within the application.

The utility function <SwmToken path="dynamics/src/main/abl/af/sup/winstyle.p" pos="142:3:3" line-data="     use SetWindowPos. Great, we need SetWindowPos anyway">`SetWindowPos`</SwmToken> is used to set the position of windows within the application.

```openedge abl
     use SetWindowPos. Great, we need SetWindowPos anyway
```

# Calculating Non-Client Areas

Another important utility function in Dynamics is used to let Windows calculate the size of the non-client area. This ensures proper UI layout by accurately determining the space required for window borders, title bars, and other non-client elements.

A utility function is used to let Windows calculate the size of the non-client area, ensuring proper UI layout.

```openedge abl
  /* let Windows calculate how large the NonClient area must be
```
